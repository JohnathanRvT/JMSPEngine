# JMSPEngine

## Introduction
Welcome to the JMSPEngine game engine project! JMSPEngine is a 3D/2D game engine built using C++. The engine is in the early stages of development.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Set up a basic project structure and build system. This might include creating a main loop, setting up a window and renderer, and handling input.
- [ ] Implement basic rendering capabilities. This might include support for 2D and 3D graphics, shaders, and loading and rendering models.
- [ ] Add support for physics. This might include implementing a physics engine and integrating it with the renderer.
- [ ] Implement a scene graph. This will allow you to organize and manage your game objects in a hierarchical structure.
- [ ] Add support for audio. This might include loading and playing back audio files, as well as integrating audio with the game world.
- [ ] Implement a user interface system. This might include support for text rendering, buttons, and other UI elements.
- [ ] Add support for networking. This might include implementing multiplayer support, as well as integrating with external APIs such as Steam.
- [ ] Implement support for scripting. This might include integrating with a scripting language such as Lua or Python.
- [ ] Add support for asset management. This might include tools for loading and managing game assets such as models, textures, and audio files.
- [ ] Implement tools and utilities for game development. This might include a level editor, a particle editor, or other tools to help developers create and test their games.
